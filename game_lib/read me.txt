WPT LOGIN TEST VERSION 1
MADE BY SEBBE @ STONESPINE EU

Start application by opening the folder "game_lib" and press "game" (jar)

Test login:
username: sebbe
password: f

Test login (banned user)
username: kekw
password: f

In order to sign up for raids you must have characters, these can be created in "add character" in the menu.

Show raid overview is just displaying some static information for testing purposes, this will later show information
about the selected raid.

Raid confirms has yet to be implemented, it will basically display all players signed up for selected raid. Depending if
they're signed or not, their names will appear with a special colour:
color code: green=confirmed, red=declined

Admin tools exists, however, UI has not been updated to show those features yet. Features that exists are:
I)   ban user
II)  confirm / decline a user for a raid event
III) create a raid event
IV)  remove a raid event


Feel free to pm me on discord if you got any suggestions/ideas

Server side has yet to be coded, this is all client side. Nothing is saved after a session shutdown and charcters have to be recreated.
The idea is that the server will be hosted by my raspberry pi3 (and preferably be on 24/7), if i cant get it to
work i will look for other solutions.

I have no date for when this will be done or if it will ever be done, no promises.
